# Obective
Main objective that is aimed by this analysis is to provide insights in order to support decision making and strategies within the realm of: 
- Optimizing revenue based on January 2023 record 
- Understanding demand trends and how to capitalize off of such findings
- Identification of revenue opportunities based on trip volume demands

# Conclusion
- Shown by a strong pattern within January 2023, that around the weekdays, especially Thursdays, followed by the day before or after (being Wednesdays and Fridays) are the days with most trip volume.
- In terms of timing, highest block of trips were shown to be around 3PM (15:00) to 7PM (19:00), followed by second highest block within 7AM (7:00) to 10AM (8:00) wihtin the days mentioned in previous point.
- Similar hourly volume block shown similar pattern within the weekends, while there also seem to be demands after midnights. Likely coming from late night entertainments within the weekends.
- Distance-wise, weekdays shown shorter distance trips in January 2023 compared to the weekend counterparts.
- While the peak weekdays shown average shorter trips, revenue shown to be higher compared to the weekends due to more volume.

# Recommendation
- **Optimizing supply within peak days and peak hours:** While the peak days and peak hours shown to bring the highest transaction/trip volume and revenues, it seems that there are ceiling of average daily trips within said days within January 2023. This also needs to be adjusted to different factors such as: the historical and projected traffic levels, competitions alongside their supplies and pricings, as well as future trends.
- **Prioritizing shorter distance trips and potential low hanging fruits:** In terms of having higher revenues, other than optimizing what was mentioned in previous point, there are opportunities shown by other potentially-high volume times such as morning rush hours within the weekdays, afternoon times within the weekends, followed by late night demands in the weekends respectively.
